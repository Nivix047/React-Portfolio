# React-Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio page with minimalistic design using react. The purpose of this project is to get introduced to building web applications with react components. React breaks down the web app into different components making coding more efficient and flexible. A very important tool used in this project was Hooks. With hooks, state can be used to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.
